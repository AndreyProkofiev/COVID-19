# COVID-19
Plots and analysis relating to the pandemic

1) LAHeatmaps.R generates heatmaps showing Local Authority trajectories in both confirmed COVID-19 cases and estimated COVID-19 deaths (in hospitals only) inspired by similar plots for US states from @Marco_Piani. The approach to modelling deaths, which are only published at NHS trust level, was developed by @Benj_Barr

2) AllCauseMortality.R harmonises weekly all-cause mortality data from England & Wales (from ONS), Scotland (from NRS) and Northern Ireland (from NISRA) and draws plots comparing deaths in 2020 so far to the previous decade, split by age, sex and region inspired by a plot from @EdConwaySky
