An initial attempt to understand the potential inequality impacts of the pandemic, before official data became available.<br><br>
[Estimated Cases By IMD.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Initial%20Inequality%20Estimates/Estimated%20Cases%20by%20IMD.R) takes published figures on confirmed COVID-19 cases by Local Authority in England and maps that onto quintiles of the Index of Multiple Deprivation, then plots a variety of case trajectories by deprivation quintile as well as a map of confirmed case rates.
