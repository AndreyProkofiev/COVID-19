Mapping potential population exposure to COVID-19.<br><br>
[COVIDExposures.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/Exposure%20mapping/COVIDExposures.R) brings together data on health deprivation and estimates of the potential COVID-19 mortality risk based on the age-sex structure of the population (following the approach developed by [@ikashnitsky](https://twitter.com/ikashnitsky) and [@jm_aburto](https://twitter.com/jm_aburto)) at Lower Super Output Area level and plots bivariate maps highlighting areas with the greatest potential COVID-19 risk. I also made a Shiny app which creates slightly lower resolution versions of the same plots online, which you can find [here](https://victimofmaths.shinyapps.io/covidmapper/).
