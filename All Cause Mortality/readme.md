Analysis of data on weekly all-cause mortality during the pandemic<br><br>
[AllCauseDeaths.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/All%20Cause%20Mortality/AllCauseDeaths.R) harmonises weekly all-cause mortality data from England & Wales (from ONS), Scotland (from NRS) and Northern Ireland (from NISRA) and draws plots comparing deaths in 2020 so far to the previous decade, split by age, sex and region inspired by a plot from [@EdConwaySky](https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky).
<br><br>[ScottishAllCauseDeathsDetail.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/All%20Cause%20Mortality/ScottishAllCauseDeathsDetail.R) uses richer data published by NRS to look at patterns in excess mortality in Scotland by place of death, Health Board area and age.<br><br>
[AllCauseDeathsxAge.R](https://github.com/VictimOfMaths/COVID-19/blob/master/All%20Cause%20Mortality/AllCauseDeathsxAge.R) Compares age-specific excess mortality rates between UK countries and brings in international data from the [Human Mortality Database](https://www.mortality.org/) for comparison.
